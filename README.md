# Horiseon Adjustments

## Description
In this assignment, we were instructed to disect the website and make it more appealing. I started by making sure the HTML code was semantic. Some of the code needed to be edited to make it easier to read as a developer. This was also done during the project. I changed some of the tags in the HTML which meant I needed to update them with the style sheet as well.  Some of the code in the style sheet was not needed to make the code work. It was added lines of code that could have been compressed into the same style property. That was done and made the code a lot easier to read since the code was not as long. One of the things missing in the HTML was the accessability of the navbar to navigate to the proper article. That change was made as well. I was able to learn to disect a webpage to make it user friendly which will help me learn how to adjust future projects.
